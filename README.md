A mini threat detection and analysis project inspired by the 2021 **JBS ransomware attack**.  
This blue team simulation demonstrates how adversaries abuse PowerShell, perform credential access, and retrieve payloads â€” and how we can detect them with **Sysmon**, **PowerShell scripting**, and **Power BI dashboards**.

## Why I Made This

This project was created as part of my research into attack detection tools commonly used in the industry. My goal was to simulate attacker-like behaviour based on a **real-world ransomware case (REvil)**, extract logs with **custom scripting**, map detections to the **MITRE ATT&CK framework**, and demonstrate everything visually in **Power BI**.

## Real-World Case Study: The JBS Ransomware Attack

In May 2021, the world's largest meat supplier, **JBS**, was targeted by the REvil ransomware group. The attack disrupted meat production across North America and Australia, leading to an $11 million ransom payout. It involved:
- Use of credential access tools and remote payload delivery
- File encryption and operational shutdowns
- Abuse of PowerShell for lateral movement and data exfiltration

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

| PowerShell Command | Technique | MITRE ID | Tactic |
|--------------------|-----------|----------|--------|
| `Invoke-WebRequest` | Ingress Tool Transfer | T1105 | Command & Control |
| `New-Object Net.WebClient` | Command Execution | T1059 | Execution |
| `reg query HKLM\SAM` | OS Credential Dumping | T1003 | Credential Access |

## Tools Used

- **Sysmon** â€“ Logs process creation, network, and file events  
- **PowerShell** â€“ Scripting to parse and export logs  
- **Power BI** â€“ Dashboard visualisation of IOC activity  
- **Visual Studio Code** â€“ Script and site editing  
- **GitHub Pages** â€“ Deployed as a public demo site
